CHIP 8 emulator for Flipper Zero
================================

This is a CHIP-8 emulator for [Flipper Zero](https://flipperzero.one/). I made this project together with [@mega8bit](https://github.com/mega8bit)
as part of the [Flipper Zero hackathon](https://habr.com/ru/company/flipperdevices/blog/595325/)

What we made:
+ Full CHIP-8 CPU and GPU realization
+ Loading CHIP-8's ROM from SD cards

What we didn't made:
+ Controlling are unavailable, because CHIP-8 using specific async event management. But we tried :)
